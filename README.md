# Python-Challenge
 
This is my second attempt at this assignment.

To help me complete the assignment I worked with my tutor and used several online soures such as python.org, geeks for geeks, and stack overflow. I also have a python for beginers book.

I used GitHub desk top to push my files. Even though it says 'image' they are not images.
